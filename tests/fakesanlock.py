    With fake sanlock, you can use code depending on sanlock, without
    running a sanlock daemon, and waiting for slow sanlock operations
    such as adding a lockspace.

    You can also simulate any error from sanlock by setting an error in
    the errors dictionary before calling a method.

    To test code importing sanlock, monkeypatch sanlock module::

        from fakesanlock import FakeSanlock
