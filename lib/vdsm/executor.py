    Executes potentially blocking task into background
    threads. Can replace stuck threads with fresh ones.

    It works as follows:

    - Newly added tasks (see `dispatch()` method) are put into the executor's
      task queue.  The maximum length of the queue is set with `max_tasks`
      constructor parameter.

    - There are workers (threads) running concurrently and taking the requests
      from the queue.  The initial number of the workers is set with
      `workers_count` parameter.

    - Each of the workers waits a certain amount of time for the completion of
      any processed task.  If the time is exceeded then the worker continues
      processing the task but another worker is created not to limit
      availability of task processing.  When the original worker finishes
      executing the long task, it's finished.

    - However there is a limit on the total number of the workers in the
      executor, set with `max_workers`.  If the limit is reached, no new
      workers are created and the whole processing may get stuck until some of
      the stuck task finishes.  This prevents creating an excessive number
      of threads when many tasks are stuck.
