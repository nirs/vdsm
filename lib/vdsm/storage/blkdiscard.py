# The kernel reports the maximum value of WRITE_SAME in
# /sys/devices/virtual/dm-*/queue/write_same_max_bytes. However testing
# shows that this value is not reliable. For example, with LIO, the
# reported value is 65535 * 512, but the server will fail any request
# bigger than 4096 * 512.
#
# When the request fails, the kernel *silently* falls-back to
# inefficient manually writing zeros, and changes both the LV and the
# underlying multipath device write_same_max_bytes to 0. Future
# BLKZEROOUT requests on any LV on this multipath device will use the
# inefficient manual zero fallback.
#
# qemu-img is using 2 MiB by defualt for BLKZEROOUT during qemu-img
# convert, so we can safely use the same value.
#
# Note: on newer kernels (>4.12), the kernel is not using WRITE_SAME for
# zeroing. We will need to test again this value when we require newwer
# kernel.
